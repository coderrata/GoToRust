# GoToRust
An attempt to create a Rust style borrow/checker system in Go. Uses the official Golang repo.

## GOALS
- Create a borrow/checker system similar to Rust's
- Use additive programming (package?)
- No need to change existing code
- Keep current syntax
- ...

## Important Information
- This will be from the experience of an absolute novice (I did attend a coding boot camp).
- All of my journey will be documented:
  - in the NOTES.md file.
  - video Documentation is being done, at some point may be released.
- I have no experience doing this.
- I have never worked on a compiler.
- Working on small projects(mostly), has not allowed me to really dive into deep understanding of a single programming language.
- I was finding it frustrating to know the nuances of so many lanaguages.
- I am doing this as a challenge to myself.

#### Previous Experience
- I have worked on numerous mainly small projects throughout multiple languages.
  - Worked on a full-blown website desinging the front and backend for a local roofing company to manage sales, customers, managers, etc.
  - Created numerous APIs and API integrations for working/experimental projects.
  - Assisted with numerous issues with different codebases under tight deadlines.
