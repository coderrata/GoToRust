**Day One:**
- Youtube'd Go compiler
  - Learned where to locate the compiler code
  - Came across Go arenas experimental Garbage Collection system to see its relevance to what I'm doing. I don't think there is any.
  - Compiler trying to get ASM output from Go compiler
    - is it necessary? ...right now?
  - Skip trying to get ASM output from Go compiler
  - Looking for in-depth knowledge of compiler
  - Finding the compiler code
    - `/src/cmd/compile/internal`
      - has a great README
      - parser and types are not really used by the compiler
        - WILL I NEED TO MODIFY THIS?
- Understand now that I need to adjust the PARSER!, because that deals with the syntax of a language and whether it is correct or not.
